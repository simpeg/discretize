Cylindrical Meshes
==================

Cylindrical meshes are useful when solving 3D differential equations
that posess rotational symmetry. Cylindrical meshes are defined in terms of *r*
(radial position), *z* (vertical position) and *phi* (azimuthal position).
Here we demonstrate:

    - how to construct cylindrical meshes
    - how to plot cylindrical meshes
    - how to extract properties from cylindrical meshes

###############################################
# Basic Example
# -------------
#
# The easiest way to define a cylindrical mesh is to define the cell widths in
# *r*, *phi* and *z* as 1D numpy arrays, and to provide a Cartesian position
# for the bottom of the vertical axis of symmetry of the mesh. Note that:
#
#    1. *phi* is in radians
#    2. The sum of values in the numpy array for *phi* cannot exceed :math:`2\pi`
#
#

ncr = 10  # number of mesh cells in r
ncp = 8  # number of mesh cells in phi
ncz = 15  # number of mesh cells in z
dr = 15  # cell width r
dz = 10  # cell width z

hr = dr * np.ones(ncr)
hp = (2 * np.pi / ncp) * np.ones(ncp)
hz = dz * np.ones(ncz)

x0 = 0.0
y0 = 0.0
z0 = -150.0

# Padding Cells and Extracting Properties
# ---------------------------------------
#
# For practical purposes, the user may want to define a region where the cell
# widths are increasing/decreasing in size. For example, padding is often used
# to define a large domain while reducing the total number of mesh cells.
# Here we demonstrate how to create cylindrical meshes that have padding cells.
# We then show some properties that can be extracted from cylindrical meshes.
#

# contains the cell with, number of cells and the expansion factor (+ve/-ve).

# Cylindrical Mesh for Rotational Symmetry
# ----------------------------------------
#
# Cylindrical mesh are most useful when solving problems with perfect
# rotational symmetry. More precisely when:
#
#    - field components in the *phi* direction are 0
#    - fluxes in *r* and *z* are 0
#
# In this case, the size of the forward problem can be significantly reduced.
# Here we demonstrate how to create a mesh for solving differential equations
# with perfect rotational symmetry. Since the fields and fluxes are independent
# of the phi position, there will be no need to discretize along the phi
# direction.

hr = [(dr, ncr), (dr, npad_r, exp_r)]
hz = [(dz, npad_z, -exp_z), (dz, ncz), (dz, npad_z, exp_z)]

# A value of 1 is used to define the discretization in phi for this case.
mesh = CylMesh([hr, 1, hz], x0="00C")

# The bottom end of the vertical axis of rotational symmetry
x0 = mesh.x0

# The total number of cells

# An (nC, 3) array containing the cell-center locations
