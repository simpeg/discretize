Discretize Meshes (:mod:`discretize`)
=====================================
.. currentmodule:: discretize

The ``discretize`` package contains four types of meshes for soliving partial differential
equations using the finite volume method.

Mesh Classes
============
.. autosummary::
  :toctree: generated/

  TensorMesh
  CylindricalMesh
  CurvilinearMesh
  TreeMesh

Tree Mesh Cells
===============
The :class:`~discretize.tree_mesh.TreeCell` class was designed specificialy to define the cells within tree meshes.
Instances of :class:`~discretize.tree_mesh.TreeCell` are not meant to be created on there own.
However, they can be returned directly by indexing a particular cell within a tree mesh.
