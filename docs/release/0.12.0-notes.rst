``discretize`` 0.12.0 Release Notes
===================================

October 8, 2025

This minor release contains many bugfixes and updates related to new package builds.

Python versions
---------------
`discretize` has bumped its minimum supported `python` version to 3.11, and is tested against versions 3.11-3.14. Minimum scipy versions
have also been bumped to 1.12. Users on older python versions should continue to use `discretize` 0.11.x.

We have also added support for (and tests against) free-threaded python builds for python 3.13 and later, which should be available through
the normal python distribution channels (pypi, conda-forge).

``TreeMesh`` updates
--------------------
Tree meshes now support a `refine_image` method that allows users to refine a mesh based on an image (2D or 3D numpy array). See
:func:``discretize.TreeMesh.refine_image`` for more details.

``TensorMesh`` updates
----------------------
A new :func:``discretize.TensorMesh.point2index`` method has been added to convert a point location to the corresponding cell index in
a tensor mesh, similar to the existing :func:``discretize.TreeMesh.point2index`` method.
