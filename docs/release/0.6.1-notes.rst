``discretize`` 0.6.1 Release Notes
===================================

November 17, 2020

This patch release adds deprecation for 3 of the hidden properties on the TreeMesh.
These properties are now publicly accessible.

* ``_aveCC2FxStencil`` → ``average_cell_to_total_face_x``
* ``_aveCC2FyStencil`` → ``average_cell_to_total_face_y``
* ``_aveCC2FzStencil`` → ``average_cell_to_total_face_z``

In addition, we have promoted the cell gradient stencils to publicly accessible as:

* ``_cellGradStencil`` → ``stencil_cell_gradient``
* ``_cellGradxStencil`` → ``stencil_cell_gradient_x``
* ``_cellGradyStencil`` → ``stencil_cell_gradient_y``
* ``_cellGradzStencil`` → ``stencil_cell_gradient_z``

We continue to discourage against accessing hidden variables as there is no guarantee
that their name will stay the same.
