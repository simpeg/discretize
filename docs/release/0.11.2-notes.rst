``discretize`` 0.11.2 Release Notes
===================================

January 28, 2025

This is a bugfix release for discretize with some minor updates.

Updates
=======

Fixed Bugs
----------
* ``is_scalar`` will now return true for any numpy array broadcastable as a scalar (any array with ``arr.size == 1``).
* Explicitly set diagonal balancing on internal plotting and reading routines that build a ``TreeMesh``.
* Fixes formatting across line breaks in new warnings.
* the ``Zero`` and ``Identity`` classes now return expected truthiness values: ``bool(Zero()) == False`` and ``bool(Identity()) == True``.
